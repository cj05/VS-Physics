# VS Physics
an addon to valkerien skies, adding a cfd on to ships
very early in development, trying to get a cfd to stabilize

CFD uses Boltzman-Lattice Algorithm on gpu

# Building
atm there is only the cfd's code in c++, it uses opencl(and opencl wrapper, https://github.com/ProjectPhysX/OpenCL-Wrapper) to utilize gpu

You can compile the cfd with any c++-11 compliant complier

# Eta?
uh no i just work on this whenever i am free
